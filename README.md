# SDL_MessAround
(Half of) Space invaders in C++ w/ SDL2!

### Note:
I purposefully avoided using smart pointers here to better my understanding of fundamental C++ concepts.

## Setup:
Follow any SDL2 (+SDL_Image) tutorial for project setup to be able to compile and run the application. 
Place SDL2.dll and SDL2_image.dll in the root directory of your solution to be able to run it.
